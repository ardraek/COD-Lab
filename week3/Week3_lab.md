# Program 1: 
### Statement: <Convert a 32-bit value from Little Endian to Big Endian format using RISC-V assembly>

### Name of file:
<week3>

### Observation - Single Cycle
- <the code loads a number and performs AND operation on it with the biggest 8 bit number.it then shifts the results to the right,it continues to do this until the number is reversed>
 
### Register Mapping
- **<x11,x12,x13,x14,x20,x21,x22>:** <0x00000000,00000011,0x00000011,0x22221111,0x00000004,0x00000004,0xfffffff8>

### Data Mapping
- **<0x10000004,0x10000000>:** <0x22221111,0x11112222>
